## üì¶ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Supabase account (for database and authentication)

cd outfitly
npm install
```

### 2. Supabase Setup

2. In your Supabase dashboard, click "Connect to Supabase" button in the top right
3. The environment variables will be automatically configured

### 3. Database Schema
Create the following tables in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Users table is automatically handled by Supabase Auth

-- Outfits table
CREATE TABLE outfits (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  image_url text NOT NULL,
  title text NOT NULL,
  description text,
  tags text[] DEFAULT '{}',
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Recommendations table
CREATE TABLE recommendations (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  outfit_id uuid REFERENCES outfits(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  category text NOT NULL CHECK (category IN ('accessory', 'hairstyle', 'footwear', 'makeup')),
  title text NOT NULL,
  description text NOT NULL,
  image_url text NOT NULL,
  confidence decimal NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Boards table
CREATE TABLE boards (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  title text NOT NULL,
  description text,
  cover_image text,
  is_private boolean DEFAULT false,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Board items table
CREATE TABLE board_items (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  board_id uuid REFERENCES boards(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  outfit_id uuid REFERENCES outfits(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  recommendation_id uuid REFERENCES recommendations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE outfits ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE recommendations ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE boards ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE board_items ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage their own outfits" ON outfits
  FOR ALL TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can view recommendations for their outfits" ON recommendations
  FOR SELECT TO authenticated
  USING (outfit_id IN (SELECT id FROM outfits WHERE user_id = auth.uid()));

CREATE POLICY "Users can manage their own boards" ON boards
  FOR ALL TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can manage their own board items" ON board_items
  FOR ALL TO authenticated
  USING (board_id IN (SELECT id FROM boards WHERE user_id = auth.uid()));
```

### 4. Storage Setup
1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to Storage
2. Create a new bucket called `images`
3. Set the bucket to public
4. Configure the following policy for the bucket:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload images" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'images');

CREATE POLICY "Images are publicly accessible" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT TO public
  USING (bucket_id = 'images');
```

### 5. Run the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`
